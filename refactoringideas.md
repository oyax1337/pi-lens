## Feature Gap Assessment: Real-Time Agent Feedback

*Assessed 2026-04-05 against 3.7.0 codebase.*

---

### 1. The Silence Problem — "All Clear" Confirmation Signal

**Priority: High | Complexity: Low**

**Gap:** When the pipeline runs clean, `index.ts` executes `if (!output) return` — the agent
gets nothing back. It cannot distinguish "I ran all checks and everything is fine" from "the
runner was skipped / errored silently". Agents currently move forward on faith, not confirmation.

**Fix:** Emit a brief positive summary whenever the pipeline completes with no blockers:
```
✓ TypeScript clean · ✓ tests pass (12/12) · ✓ no secrets · 3 runners · 847ms
```
Only suppress this when the tool is non-file-writing (read, bash, etc.) — not on edit/write.

**Implementation:** In `pipeline.ts` `runPipeline()`, when `output` is empty, assemble a
one-liner from the phases that actually ran: dispatch runner statuses, test result, format
changed flag. Already have all this data in `PipelineResult`. ~50 lines.

**Controlled by:** `--no-all-clear` flag or config key for agents that find it noisy.

---

### 2. Batch / Transaction Mode — Suppress Mid-Refactor Noise

**Priority: High | Complexity: Medium**

**Gap:** When an agent refactors across 5 files in one turn (rename a type, update all callers),
each write fires the pipeline independently. After file 2, the LSP sees 3 unresolved
references and reports blocking errors — even though the agent is mid-refactor and will fix
them in the next 3 writes. These intermediate errors derail agents.

**Existing hook:** `turn_end` already collects all written files and runs jscpd/madge as a
batch. The scaffolding is there.

**Fix (two-part):**
1. **Cascade diagnostics** (other files with errors) → defer to `turn_end`, not per-write.
   These are the noisiest mid-refactor. Already isolated in the `cascade_diagnostics` phase.
2. **LSP errors on the *edited* file itself** → keep immediate (real errors the agent made).
   LSP errors on *other* files (callers, importers) → defer.

**Implementation:** Track `pendingCascadeDiagnostics` in turn state, flush at `turn_end`.
`pipeline.ts` already has `ctx.cwd` and `cacheManager` to write turn state. ~100 lines.

**Risk:** Agents that write a file and immediately expect cross-file feedback might miss it.
Document clearly: "cascade errors flush at end of turn, not per-write."

---

### 3. Build Verification — Beyond LSP Type-Checking

**Priority: Medium | Complexity: Low-Medium**

**Gap:** LSP does incremental type-checking but misses full-project build errors: tsconfig
path aliases that LSP resolves but `tsc` rejects, Rust proc-macros, Go build tags, missing
generated files. Agents have shipped "LSP-clean" code that fails `cargo build`.

**Per-language runners to add:**
- `cargo check` (Rust) — faster than `cargo build`, catches all type/borrow errors. Already
  have `rust-client.ts`; add as an optional dispatch runner triggered only when `.rs` written.
- `go build ./...` (Go) — 1-3s, catches missing imports, build tags. Complement `go-vet`.
- `tsc --noEmit` (TypeScript) — only worth running when LSP is NOT active (`--lens-lsp`
  already covers this via `ts-lsp` runner); could be the fallback when no LSP.

**Implementation:** New runners `cargo-check.ts` and `go-build.ts` in `dispatch/runners/`.
`cargo check` output is already parseable (same format as `cargo clippy`). Gated behind
file-kind detection — only fires on `.rs` / `.go` files.

---

### 4. Coverage Signal — Did New Code Get Tested?

**Priority: Low-Medium | Complexity: Medium-High**

**Gap:** The test runner says pass/fail. It doesn't say whether the agent's newly written
code was actually exercised. An agent can write a function, write a test that imports but
doesn't call it, watch it pass, and think it's covered.

**Constraint:** Coverage runs require instrumentation (`--coverage`) which adds 2-5× overhead
to the test step. Unacceptable for the default per-write pipeline.

**Viable approach:** Run coverage only when:
- Tests fail (to show *which* branches are untested) — already bad news, overhead acceptable.
- On demand via flag `--lens-coverage`.
- At `turn_end` only (not per-write).

**Implementation:** Pass `--coverage --reporter=json` to vitest/jest, parse
`coverage/coverage-summary.json`, emit "new function `processPayment` has 0% coverage" if
the edited function's line range is uncovered. Requires correlating edit location with
coverage map — non-trivial but doable with the line-range data already tracked in pipeline.

---

### 5. Agent-Specific Anti-Patterns

**Priority: High | Complexity: Low (stubs) → Medium (TODOs) → High (imports)**

**Gap:** Agents have failure modes that no standard linter targets:

**5a. Stub detection** — agents scaffold then forget to implement:
```typescript
throw new Error("not implemented");
throw new Error("TODO");
pass  # Python
raise NotImplementedError
```
AST-grep rule catches all of these in <10ms. Already have the `ast-grep-napi` runner.
Add as a new rule in `rules/ast-grep-rules/` with `semantic: "warning"`. **~20 lines.**

**5b. Stale TODOs from this turn** — agent adds `// TODO: handle error` as a placeholder,
finishes the turn, never resolves it. Turn state already tracks written files; scan them
at `turn_end` for TODOs added since baseline. Delta-mode already has the baseline mechanism.
**~50 lines.**

**5c. Hallucinated API detection** — agent imports `stripe.createPaymentIntentV2()` which
doesn't exist. LSP catches this for TS/Python if the package is installed. The gap is when
the package isn't installed (agent hallucinated the whole dep). Dependency-checker.ts already
exists — cross-reference new imports against installed packages. **Medium complexity.**

---

### 6. Dependency Hygiene on Edit

**Priority: Low-Medium | Complexity: Low**

**Gap:** When an agent edits `package.json` or `requirements.txt`, no feedback on whether
the new dependency is deprecated, has a known CVE, or doesn't exist on the registry.

**Existing asset:** `clients/dependency-checker.ts` already exists. Unclear if it runs
automatically on `package.json` writes — likely only on demand.

**Fix:** In the pipeline, when `filePath` ends with `package.json` or `requirements.txt`,
trigger `dependency-checker` as part of dispatch. Gate behind file-kind check.
`npm audit --json` and `pip-audit --json` both produce structured output.

**Constraint:** `npm audit` takes 2-5s (network call). Run async / non-blocking, report
at turn_end rather than inline. Or run only when new dependencies are detected (diff
the file against baseline to detect added deps, skip if no new entries).

---

## /lens-booboo Tools: Real-Time Promotion Assessment

*Which booboo-only tools should move into the per-write pipeline?*

---

### Complexity Metrics — NO, keep in booboo only

**Current:** booboo-only (`ComplexityClient.analyzeFile(filePath)`)  
**Assessment: Not actionable for agents in real-time**

`analyzeFile` is fast (<5ms, pure in-memory), so the cost argument is fine. The problem
is that agents almost never reduce complexity unprompted mid-task. If the task is
"add Stripe integration", the agent won’t stop to restructure a function that hits
cyclomatic complexity 12. It acknowledges the warning and continues.

Complexity warnings also have no clear single action (extract? split? simplify conditions?)
and are often intentional — 8 payment error cases means 8 branches, necessarily.

Additional problem: if the agent builds a complex function over 4 incremental writes, the
warning fires 4 times for the same growing function. Delta-mode filters pre-existing
complexity but not "complexity you’re actively introducing this turn."

Booboo is exactly the right home: it’s the deliberate quality review pass where the agent
(or human) has specifically asked "what needs improving?" That’s when complexity is
actionable. Real-time pipeline should be reserved for things that *change what the agent
does next*. Complexity doesn’t clear that bar.

---

### Architectural Rules — ALREADY A DISPATCH RUNNER ✓

**Current:** `dispatch/runners/architect.ts` registered and wired into both standard and full-lint plans  
**Assessment: Already done — no action needed**

Registered at priority 40, runs as `mode: "fallback"` on `jsts` and `python` files in both
plans. `checkFile` is pure in-memory (<1ms). Nothing to do here.

---

### TODO Scanner — PARTIAL (already in refactoringideas as delta-mode)

**Current:** booboo-only (`TodoScanner.scanFile(filePath)`)  
**Assessment: Don’t run per-write, run delta at turn_end**

`scanFile` is fast (regex), but running it on every write is wrong: the agent *just* wrote
`// TODO: handle edge case` intentionally. Flagging it immediately is noise.

The right model: at `turn_end`, diff the TODO list against the session baseline and flag
any *net-new* TODOs added this turn that weren’t resolved. This is the "stale TODOs"
idea already in the refactoringideas. Don’t add a per-write runner.

---

### Knip — NO

**Current:** session_start (cached) + booboo  
**Assessment: Wrong granularity, wrong speed**

Knip is fundamentally a whole-project tool. It builds a full import graph across all files
to find unused exports/deps. A per-file trigger makes no sense — deleting one export from
file A doesn’t tell you whether it’s unused until you’ve scanned all of file A’s importers.
30s timeout. Already cached at session_start. Adding it to the per-write pipeline would
be strictly worse: slow, noisy, and structurally incorrect.

---

### Type Coverage — NO

**Current:** booboo-only (`npx type-coverage` subprocess, 30s timeout)  
**Assessment: Wrong tool for real-time, already covered**

`type-coverage` spawns an npx process that runs a full TypeScript project scan.
Per-write this is 5–30s overhead. Not viable.

More importantly, the `no-any-type` AST-grep rule already catches `as any` and `: any`
per-file in <1ms. The metric ("87% typed") is useful for the booboo summary report but
not actionable per-write.

---

### jscpd — ALREADY CORRECT (turn_end)

Line-range-filtered duplicate detection at `turn_end`. This is the right placement:
duplication only makes sense once a block is complete, not mid-write.

---

### Madge (circular deps) — ALREADY CORRECT (turn_end)

Checked at `turn_end` when imports change. Per-write would produce false positives
during refactors (add new import before removing old one).

---

### Production Readiness — NO (it’s a composite of things already covered)

`validateProductionReadiness` is a project-level report: scans all source files for
`console.log`, TODOs, empty catches, `as any`, debuggers, missing test files, missing
docs, missing config files. Every individual check it does is either:
- Already a dispatch runner (empty-catch, debugger, as-any via AST-grep; console-log via tree-sitter)
- Covered by the TODO delta approach above
- Structural/project-level (missing README, no CI config) — booboo is the right home

Promoting `production-readiness.ts` to real-time would duplicate existing runners.

---

### Booboo Promotion Summary

| Tool | Realtime? | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Complexity metrics | **No — keep in booboo** | Not actionable mid-task; agents ignore it; booboo is the right review moment |
| Architectural rules | **Already a dispatch runner ✓** | Fast, per-file, wired in both plans |
| TODO scanner | **turn_end delta only** | Per-write is noisy; delta catches unresolved placeholders |
| Knip | No | Whole-project, 30s, structurally wrong |
| Type coverage | No | Subprocess, slow, AST-grep already covers it |
| jscpd | Already turn_end | Correct placement |
| Madge | Already turn_end | Correct placement |
| Production readiness | No | Composite of already-covered checks |

## LSP Launch: Use cross-spawn (from opencode)

**Status:** Low priority - current manual Windows handling works
**Priority:** Cleanup/refactoring, not a bug fix
**Reference:** `C:/Users/R3LiC/desktop/opencode/packages/opencode/src/util/process.ts`

### Problem
The current `clients/lsp/launch.ts` has ~100 lines of manual Windows process spawning logic:
- `.cmd`/`.bat` detection
- Shell mode heuristics  
- npm global path resolution
- `windowsHide` handling

### Solution
Use `cross-spawn` package (same one npm/yarn use):

```typescript
import launch from "cross-spawn";

export function spawn(cmd: string[], opts: Options = {}): ChildProcess {
  const proc = launch(cmd[0], cmd.slice(1), {
    cwd: opts.cwd,
    shell: opts.shell,
    env: opts.env,
    stdio: [opts.stdin ?? "ignore", opts.stdout ?? "ignore", opts.stderr ?? "ignore"],
    windowsHide: process.platform === "win32",
  });
  // ... rest of wrapper
}
```

### Benefits
- Handles Windows quirks automatically (PATHEXT, shebangs, etc.)
- Battle-tested (used by npm, yarn, webpack)
- ~100 lines of manual code → ~10 lines

## Pi SDK Extension API Assessment: RPC vs Extension vs Untapped Features

*Assessed 2026-04-05 against `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` SDK.*

### Current Architecture (What We Use)

pi-lens operates as a **pi extension** — loaded at runtime inside the agent process,
not as an external controller. This is the correct architecture for our use case.

| Feature | Usage Level | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Event hooks (`pi.on`) | ✅ Extensive | `session_start`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`, `before_agent_start` |
| CLI flags (`pi.registerFlag`) | ✅ 15+ flags | `lens-lsp`, `no-biome`, `error-debt`, `auto-install`, etc. |
| Slash commands (`pi.registerCommand`) | ✅ 2 commands | `/lens-booboo`, `/lens-tdi` |
| Custom tools (`pi.registerTool`) | ✅ 3 tools | `autofix`, `booboo`, `tdi` |
| UI primitives (`ctx.ui`) | ⚠️ Partial | `notify()`, `setStatus()` in auto-loop; no widgets/footers |
| Message sending (`pi.sendUserMessage`) | ⚠️ Minimal | `auto-loop.ts` for follow-up messages |

### What We're NOT Using (Assessment)

#### 1. **RPC Client (`RpcClient`) — WRONG ABSTRACTION**

The `RpcClient` is for **external programs** controlling pi headlessly:
```typescript
// External script, NOT an extension
const client = new RpcClient({ cwd: "/project" });
await client.start();
await client.prompt("Refactor this codebase");
await client.waitForIdle();
```

**Verdict:** Not applicable. pi-lens is an extension running *inside* pi's process.
The Extension API (`ExtensionAPI`) is the correct interface.

**When RPC matters:** CI/CD pipelines, IDE integrations, test harnesses driving pi
programmatically. We don't need this.

---

#### 2. **EventBus (`pi.events`) — UNUSED BUT VALID**

Simple pub/sub for extension-to-extension communication:
```typescript
pi.events.emit("lens-diagnostics", { file, errors });
// Other extension subscribes:
pi.events.on("lens-diagnostics", handler);
```

**Use case:** Multi-extension coordination. If another extension wanted real-time
lint data (e.g., a custom TUI widget, a web dashboard), EventBus would be the channel.

**Verdict:** Not needed now. Our architecture uses:
- Internal state (caches, maps)
- Context injection (`pi.on("context", ...)`) to surface to LLM
- Return values from `tool_result` to surface to user

EventBus only becomes relevant if we split pi-lens into multiple extensions or expose
a public API for other extensions to consume.

---

#### 3. **Custom Entry Persistence (`pi.appendEntry`) — WORTH CONSIDERING**

Store arbitrary JSON data in the session file (not sent to LLM):
```typescript
pi.appendEntry("lens-metrics", {
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  filesLinted: 5,
  complexityDelta: 12
});
```

**Current approach:** Disk cache in `~/.cache/pi-lens/`
- ✅ Queryable (SQLite/JSON files)
- ✅ Cross-session (same project, different sessions)
- ❌ Not portable (session file doesn't include cache)
- ❌ Orphaned data (cache lives forever)

**Custom entry approach:**
- ✅ Portable (travels with session file)
- ✅ Auto-cleanup (session deletion removes entries)
- ❌ Not queryable across sessions (each session isolated)
- ❌ Adds bloat to session file

**Verdict:** Could migrate small, session-specific state (per-session TODO baseline,
per-session complexity baselines) to entries for portability. Not urgent — current
cache approach works.

---

#### 4. **UI Primitives — UNTAPPED POTENTIAL**

| Primitive | Purpose | Our Usage | Could Use For |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| `ctx.ui.select()` | Dropdown picker | ❌ | `/lens-booboo` profile selection |
| `ctx.ui.confirm()` | Yes/no dialog | ❌ | "Continue despite warnings?" (but we block, not ask) |
| `ctx.ui.input()` | Text input | ❌ | Custom lint rule filters |
| `ctx.ui.editor()` | Multi-line editor | ❌ | Inline architect rule editing |
| `ctx.ui.setWidget()` | Persistent widget (above/below editor) | ❌ | **Live lint status during streaming** |
| `ctx.ui.setFooter()` | Custom footer | ❌ | Replace footer with lens-specific metrics |
| `ctx.ui.setHeader()` | Custom header | ❌ | Startup banner |

**Most promising: `setWidget()`**

Current: `ctx.ui.setStatus("lens", "3 files linted")` puts transient text in footer.
Problem: Footer is crowded, text scrolls away, not visible during streaming.

Widget possibility: Persistent panel above editor showing:
```
┌─ pi-lens ──────────────────────┐
│ ✓ 3 files  ⚠ 2 warnings       │
│ Tests: 12/12  Coverage: 87%    │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Verdict:** Low priority polish. Current `notify()` + `setStatus()` is sufficient.
Widgets add visual weight that may distract.

---

#### 5. **Tool Custom Rendering (`renderCall`, `renderResult`) — NOT NEEDED**

Custom TUI components for tool display:
```typescript
pi.registerTool({
  renderResult: (result, options, theme) => {
    return new MyFancyLintReportComponent(result);
  }
});
```

**Verdict:** Overkill. Our plain text output renders well in the default tool display.
Custom rendering adds maintenance burden for marginal visual gain.

---

### Recommendations (Priority Order)

| Priority | Feature | Action | Rationale |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **None** | RPC Client | Skip | Wrong abstraction; Extension API is correct |
| **None** | EventBus | Skip | No multi-extension coordination needed |
| **Low** | `appendEntry()` | Consider | Session portability for small state; migrate from cache if needed |
| **Low** | `setWidget()` | Experiment | More visible than `setStatus()`; try for persistent lint dashboard |
| **Low** | `select()`/`input()` | Skip | Command-line parsing is sufficient |
| **None** | Custom tool rendering | Skip | Plain text works; complexity not justified |

### Summary

pi-lens uses the **correct** SDK surface: the **Extension API** (event hooks, flags,
commands, tools). We are not under-utilizing the SDK — we are using the appropriate
subset for an in-process extension.

The **RPC Client** is for external controllers, not extensions. The **EventBus** is for
multi-extension ecosystems. Neither applies to our current architecture.

Future exploration worth doing:
1. **`setWidget()` prototype** — persistent lint status panel (1-2 hours to test)
2. **Migrate cache → `appendEntry()`** — only if session portability becomes important

Everything else is architectural mismatch or premature optimization.
