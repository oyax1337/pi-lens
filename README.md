# pi-lens

pi-lens focuses on real-time inline code feedback for AI agents.

## What It Does

### On Write/Edit

On every `write` and `edit`, pi-lens runs a fast, language-aware pipeline (checks depend on file language, project config, and installed tools):

1. **Secrets scan** — blocking; aborts the write if credentials are detected
2. **Auto-format** — 26 language-specific formatters (Biome, Prettier, Ruff, gofmt, rustfmt, and 21 others)
3. **Auto-fix** — safe autofixes from 6 tools (Biome `check --write`, Ruff `check --fix`, ESLint `--fix`, stylelint `--fix`, sqlfluff `fix`, RuboCop `-a`) applied before analysis
4. **LSP file sync** — opens/updates the file in active language servers
5. **Dispatch lint** — parallel runner groups: LSP diagnostics, tree-sitter structural rules, ast-grep security/correctness rules, fact rules, language-specific linters, similarity detection
6. **Cascade diagnostics** — review-graph impact cascade showing which other files were affected and how diagnostics propagated

Results are inline and actionable:
- **Blocking issues** — stop progress until fixed
- **Warnings** — summarized inline, detail in `/lens-booboo`
- **Health/telemetry** — available in `/lens-health`

### Session Start

At `session_start`, pi-lens:

- resets runtime state and diagnostic telemetry
- detects project root, language profile, and active tools
- applies language-aware startup defaults for tool preinstall
- warms caches and optional indexes (with overlap/session guardrails)
- emits missing-tool install hints for detected languages when relevant
- injects session guidance through internal context (non-user channel) to reduce acknowledgement-only first responses

For one-shot print sessions (for example `pi --print ...`), pi-lens auto-uses a quick startup path that skips heavy bootstrap work to reduce startup latency. Override with `PI_LENS_STARTUP_MODE=full|minimal|quick`.

### Turn End

At `turn_end`, pi-lens:

- summarizes deferred findings (for example duplicates/circulars)
- persists turn findings for next context injection
- updates debt/diagnostic tracking and cleans transient state
- renders a review-graph impact cascade showing affected files and diagnostic propagation
- fires test runs for all modified files (non-blocking); failures are injected into the next turn's context when ready
- manages LSP server lifecycle with a 240s idle timeout (resets when editing resumes)

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-lens
```

Or from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/apmantza/pi-lens
```

## Features

### LSP Support

pi-lens includes **37 language server definitions**. LSP is **enabled by default** (`--lsp` or no flag). Servers are auto-discovered from PATH, project `node_modules`, and managed installs. When a server is not installed, pi-lens offers an interactive install prompt.

**LSP Idle Management:** LSP servers shut down after 240 seconds of inactivity (no files modified) to free resources. The timer resets when you resume editing, preventing cold-start penalties during active development.

LSP servers for: TypeScript, Deno, Python (pyright + pylsp), Go, Rust, Ruby (ruby-lsp + solargraph), PHP, C# (omnisharp), F#, Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Lua, C/C++, Zig, Haskell, Elixir, Gleam, OCaml, Clojure, Terraform, Nix, Bash, Docker, YAML, JSON, HTML, TOML, Prisma, Vue, Svelte, ESLint, CSS.

### Formatters

pi-lens auto-detects and runs **26 formatters** based on project config:

biome, prettier, ruff, black, sqlfluff, gofmt, rustfmt, zig fmt, dart format, shfmt, nixfmt, mix format, ocamlformat, clang-format, ktlint, rubocop, standardrb, gleam format, terraform fmt, php-cs-fixer, csharpier, fantomas, swiftformat, stylua, ormolu, taplo

Detection rules:
- **Config-gated**: only runs when project config indicates usage (e.g. `biome.json`, `.prettierrc`, `ruff.toml`)
- **Nearest-wins**: when multiple formatter configs exist at different directory levels, the one closest to the edited file wins
- **Biome-default**: for JS/TS files without Prettier or Biome config, Biome is used as the default formatter
- **Ruff-default**: for Python files without Black config, Ruff format is used when available

### Review Graph - Cascade Diagnostics

pi-lens builds a review graph (`file → symbol → dependency`) during session and uses it at turn end to render an impact cascade: which files were affected by a change and how diagnostics propagated through the dependency graph. Nodes track kind, language, and export status; edges track contains/imports/calls/references.

### Read-Before-Edit Guard

pi-lens enforces a **read-before-edit** policy on all file writes and edits. Before allowing a `write` or `edit` tool call on an existing file, it verifies that the agent has previously read sufficient context:

- **Zero-read block** — blocks any edit to a file not read in the current session
- **File-modified block** — blocks if the file changed on disk since the last read (auto-format, external tool, or a previous edit that was then reformatted)
- **Out-of-range block** — blocks if the edit target lines fall outside the ranges previously read, ensuring the agent cannot modify code it hasn't seen

Coverage is tracked across multiple reads: two reads of lines 1–100 and 101–200 together satisfy a full-file write. LSP-expanded reads (single-line reads silently widened to the enclosing symbol) count toward coverage. Markdown, text, and log files are exempt.

Override for a single edit: `/lens-allow-edit <path>`

Configure behavior with `--no-read-guard` to disable entirely, or set mode to `warn` instead of `block`.

### Opportunistic Read Expansion

When the agent reads a single line of a file and a warm LSP client is already running for that language, pi-lens transparently expands the read to the full enclosing symbol (function, method, or class). This happens without blocking the read — if LSP responds in time, the agent sees the full context; otherwise the original line is returned unchanged.

### Fact Rules Pipeline

Covers JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, Shell, and CMake. Dispatch includes a fact-rule engine that extracts function-level metrics (cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, outgoing calls) and evaluates quality rules inline:

- **high-complexity** — flags functions exceeding configurable CC thresholds
- **unsafe-boundary** — detects dangerous boundary crossings (unvalidated user input → trusted context)
- **high-fan-out** — flags excessive outgoing call count (default threshold: 20)
- **comment-facts** — classifies comment quality (TODO density, doc coverage)
- **try-catch-facts** — flags empty/obscuring catch blocks
- **import-facts** — detects circular/star/unused imports
- **file-role** — classifies files as source/test/config/vendor and adjusts severity

### Tree-sitter Rules

Structural rules are organized by language in `rules/tree-sitter-queries/`:

- **TypeScript** (18 rules): console-statement, debugger, deep-nesting, eval, sql-injection, ssrf, weak-hash, unsafe-regex, variable-shadowing, and more
- **Python** (26 rules): debug statements, hardcoded secrets, mutable class attrs, unsafe regex, empty except, and more
- **Go** (17 rules): defer-in-loop, hardcoded secrets, unchecked errors, and more
- **Rust** (6 rules): unsafe blocks, unwrap outside tests, and more
- **Ruby** (15 rules): empty rescue, rescue Exception, debugger, hardcoded secrets, and more

### Ast-Grep Rules

**180+ rules** in `rules/ast-grep-rules/` across JS, TS, and Python:

- **Security** — no-eval, jwt-no-verify, no-hardcoded-secrets, no-insecure-randomness, no-inner-html, no-javascript-url, weak-rsa-key
- **Correctness** — strict-equality, no-cond-assign, no-constant-condition, no-dupe-keys, no-nan-comparison, array-callback-return, constructor-super
- **Style/smells** — nested-ternary, long-parameter-list, large-class, prefer-optional-chain, redundant-state, require-await
- **Agent stubs** — no-unimplemented-stub, no-raise-not-implemented, no-ellipsis-body

## Dependencies

Auto-install behavior depends on gate type:

- **Config-gated**: installs only when project config/deps indicate usage
- **Flow/language-gated**: installs when the runtime path needs it for the current file/session flow
- **Operational prewarm**: installs during session warm scans / turn-end analysis paths
- **GitHub release**: platform-specific binary downloaded from GitHub releases to `~/.pi-lens/bin/`

## Language Coverage

pi-lens supports **35+ languages** through dispatch runners and LSP integration.

Formatting uses a single selected formatter per file: explicit project config wins, otherwise pi-lens uses a smart default where supported, and config-first ecosystems do not autoformat without config.

Dispatch is diagnostics-oriented: automatic formatting and safe autofix happen in the post-write pipeline rather than through dispatch format-check runners.
